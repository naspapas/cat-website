            In our walk with Christ, we find that our faith is essential when confronting the enemy. When we stand on the Word of God and trust in His promises, we are engaging in a powerful defense against Satan. Our faith allows us to see beyond the immediate pressures and threats that Satan presents. We can claim victory in Jesus because He has already triumphed over sin and death for us. Believing in His might strengthens our resolve to overcome any obstacle placed in our path.

            Despite her father being a poor stay-at-home dad, Lilo was just bought a bougee new cat wheel to run her little heart out on. Hopefully she uses it or daddy will put her back to work in the mines. Pictures will come as soon as the wheel does
