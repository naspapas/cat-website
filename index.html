            So, I'm trying to ensure the cats have more stimulation during the day. I've been playing with them and brushing them a lot. I'm going to clean up the outside area more and maybe sort out some form of way to have them there more often. I need more sun as well, so I'm going to try and have them be outdoors every now and then. 
            I really hope they end up liking the cat wheel, but if not, we'll figure something else out. Here's a picture of the one I bought, thanks Kogan

            Dusty has been doing well. I'm worried he's a bit lonelier lately, so I'm trying to make sure I spend more time with him. He's a lot more affectionate in his old age. Maybe I'll add a 'pisses me off' section next update

            Lilo has been very spoilt lately, getting lots of attention and brushing. No matter how much she gets brushed, still hair everywhere. I don't get it, it's like that parks and recs deleted scene
